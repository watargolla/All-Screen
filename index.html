    1. Make sure your phone and cast device are connecting to the same Wi-Fi. if you don't have
    router or wifi then enable hotspot mode on your phone and connect your streaming device to your
    hotspot.Open the Xtreme Video Cast app on mobile, If your Streaming device(or smart TV) is supported,
    app will find it and select it. Once casting device is selected, select any media to play on it.<br><br>

    3. Try to reboot(restart) your router, cast device or phone.<br><br>

    <b>Why does the app keep getting disconnected?</b><br><br>
    It may relates to the setting of your device, so please make sure you haven't set any battery
    optimization, which may prevent app from functioning properly, for example, turning off Wi-Fi
    when the phone is not in use. If so, please turn on the setting to prevent disconnection.
